Traini8: Problem Statement

Assume that you are working at a startup Traini8. You must make an MVP for a registry for Govt funded Training Centers with the following minimum requirements. In the MVP, you must create a Spring or Play project with support for two APIs, which are explained below.

Explanation:
         Firstly, I created a spring boot project “Assignment” using “Spring Initializer” where I added all the required dependencies for my project and downloaded as a jar folder. Then In Assignment project I added all the packages and classes required for it. Then added the Postgres properties in application properties file, and all other requirements

Entities: 
 • Training center: this contains all the fields given in the requirements along with a embedded address class.

 • Address: this is a embedded class which encapsulates the fields of a address and helps in easy modifications and creation rather than single field in the main entity. Functionality: • As the given instructions in the assignment, when a new centre is created it will valid the given email and phone number whether they are in correct format or not.

 • CenterName should be below 40, CenterID should be of length 12characters, email and phone number should bein correct format if wrong will return error. Technologies Used:

Java Spring Boot for building the RESTful API.
PostgreSQL for Database management.
Postman for API documentation.
Render for Postgres and Redis Deployment
Docker for creating a image for spring boot application
